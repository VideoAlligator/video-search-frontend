# Video Search Tool (frontend)

A React App with Typescript

The goal of this project is to develop an accessible web page with a video frame searching engine powered by object detection and scene detection machine learning models.

# Prerequisite

Make sure `npm` (package manager) is installed.

# Setup

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

1. `npm install`: Install all packages

2. `npm start`: Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Other Available Scripts

`npm test`: Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

`npm run build`: Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
